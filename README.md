# mj-bot

mj-bot likes to sleep. Wake him up and ask him what to eat. Hopefully he can
stay awake.

### commands

wake up : wake up the bot!
wake up! : make some noise!
are you awake? : see how awake the bot is!
what should i eat? X or Y : find out what to eat!


### explanation

The bot will just listen for the words "wake up" which will trigger the bot to
respond with a random emoji.

If you add an exclamation point to any word then the bot will respond with a
set phrase directed at the user.

The bot counts how many times you told it to wake up. You can grab that count
by asking "are you awake?". It will then tell you the count on it's wake-o
meter.

Ask the bot what you should eat and it will decide. "what should i eat? X or Y"
where X is your first choice of food and Y will be your second choice. There
is a chance that the bot will respond with neither X or Y and just go fall
back asleep.
